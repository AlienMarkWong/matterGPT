# matterGPT
The matterGPT project aims to develop a specialized GPT model tailored for materials prediction, providing valuable insights and capabilities to the materials science community. This innovative model will leverage the power of GPT architecture and adapt it to the unique requirements of materials prediction, encompassing various material types and properties. By collecting and processing comprehensive datasets, designing custom model architecture, and continuously improving the model based on user feedback and new data, matterGPT will become a powerful tool for researchers and engineers in materials design and research. The project will also promote collaboration, community building, and comprehensive documentation, ensuring that matterGPT remains up-to-date, relevant, and user-friendly.
